# Bank Landing Page 
## JavaScript Project
## Description of App Functionality, Features, and Methods

Javascript coding project I completed from Udemy - The Complete Javascript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert by Jonas Schmedtmann. After coding this project through the course I then modified CSS so App would be more adaptive to smaller device formats (tablets but not for mobile phones). I also added commenting of code for educational purposes.

App can be run from: https://frank-pechar-js-bank-land-page.netlify.app/
